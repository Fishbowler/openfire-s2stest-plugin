<h1>S2S Test Plugin</h1>
<p>Plugin to test successful and unsuccessful connections to other servers via S2S. The tests rely on the XSF XMPP server, as well as the great range of servers generously provided at <a href="https://badxmpp.eu/">badxmpp.eu</a>.</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Successful</dt>
    <dd>A test against a known good server (XSF)</dd>
    <dt>Expired Certificate</dt>
    <dd>TLS where the certificate has already expired (and so expected to fail)</dd>
